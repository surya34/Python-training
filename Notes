- Python is Dynamic typing meaning once a variable is assigned to a data type the same variable can be re-assigned to a differrent data type , whereas other languages 
  are static typing. 
 
  Ex: test = 1 , test = ["pass","fail"] 
  
 - Type function in python is used to describe the data type 
 
   Ex: usage a = 1 , type(a)

  start this is where we start the slicing and stop is where we stop and does not include that specific postion and step is the jump we take in slicing .
