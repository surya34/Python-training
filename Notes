- Python is Dynamic typing meaning once a variable is assigned to a data type the same variable can be re-assigned to a differrent data type , whereas other languages 
  are static typing. 
 
  Ex: test = 1 , test = ["pass","fail"] 
  
 - Type function in python is used to describe the data type 
 
   Ex: usage a = 1 , type(a) 
   
- Indexing and Slicing

  Ex:  S U R Y A 
  
       0 1 2 3 4 <- indexing 
       
  usage : 
  
  - Slicing : syntax [start:stop:step] 
  
  start this is where we start the slicing and stop is where we stop and does not include that specific postion and step is the jump we take in slicing .

  To-do : check string formatting examples from notebook and practise 
  
  
  - string formatting 
  
    - .format() 
    - f-strings ( formatted string literals) - Practise on .format()  strings . 
    
    .format method , syntax: 'string here{} then also {}'.format('something1','something2')
    
    - Float formatting syntax : "{value:width.precision f}"
    
    - f-strings method
     
       Ex: name = "jose" 
       
       print (f'hello his name is {name}') 
       
       output - hello his name is jose
