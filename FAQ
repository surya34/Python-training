  Dictionaries are key value pair and unorganized and cannot be sorted , good time to use dictionary is to query a value without knowing its index position . 
  Lists are objects which can be sorted based on Indexes . 
  
  Tuples - Tuples are immutable means we cannot change the index postion or add additioal objects . 
  
  syntax , t=('a',1,'f')
